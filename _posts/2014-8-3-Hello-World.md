Some time ago working with images was a big headache- to apply any filters you should use only canvas or svg.
Also applying new color theme for your site always take many time.
But these days there is way to solve that issues- CSS filters.
##When to use
- filters/effects for images
- color themes for your site
- text, blocks effects
- etc.
##How to use
So, using is very simple, just apply css style:
	filter: FILTER-NAME1(value) [FILTER-NAME2(value), ...];
E.g., you would like to show some image in grayscal. No problem, 
CSS filters to the rescue! :)
	filter: grayscale(1);
## CSS site themes
